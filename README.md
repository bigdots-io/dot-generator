# Dot Generator

The special sauce that turns items (text, images, etc...) into dot representations to be rendered on a LED matrix. *This is a heavily tested library!*

Used internally by:

* [Node API](https://github.com/bigdots-io/bigdots-io-node)
* [Macros](https://github.com/bigdots-io/macros)

### Validating test fixtures

To see what the json dot fixtures actually look like, run...

`npm run-script fixture-ui`
